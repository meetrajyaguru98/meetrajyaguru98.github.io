  Hello, my name is Meet Rajyaguru and I am a highly motivated Chemical Engineering Professional with extensive hands-on knowledge of high-end industrial simulation software such as Aspen Plus, HYSYS, and Bluebeam RevU. I am a registered Engineer-in-Training (EIT) with the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) and currently working with the Facilities Engineering team at Strathcona Resourcesâ€™ Tucker Thermal Facility. With a passion for learning and a deep commitment to my profession, I am dedicated to expanding my expertise and knowledge in the Canadian Oil and Gas industry, specifically as a Facilities Engineer. I am eager to work closely with industry professionals and apply my skills to tackle the most challenging engineering projects and contribute to the continued success of the industry.

          As a Chemical Engineering Professional with experience in the Canadian Oil and Gas sector and a Master's degree from the University of Calgary, I bring a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical expertise to the table. With a strong foundation in plant troubleshooting and a track record of supporting successful Management of Change (MOC) initiatives, I am well-versed in the use of industrial simulation software, including IBM Maximo, Autodesk Navisworks, Bluebeam Revu, Aspen HYSYS, and MS Office. In addition, my prior work experience at Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Refinery has given me valuable insights into engineering environments, further enhancing my skillset. As a registered Engineer-In-Training (EIT) with APEGA, I am committed to upholding the highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct in all aspects of my work.

          Coupling technical expertise with project management skills and a safety-focused mindset, I strive to deliver high-quality work that meets stakeholder needs and exceeds expectations.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            As an accomplished Chemical Engineering Professional, I have extensive experience in preparing Engineering Work Packages and Construction Work Packages that span a wide range of scopes, from small replace-in-kind projects to large-scale Management of Change (MOC) initiatives that involve multiple departments and stakeholders. I have a keen eye for detail and excel at scoping projects, completing walk-downs, and managing the close-out process to ensure that all deliverables are completed on time and to the highest standards.

            One of my key strengths is my proficiency in P&ID redlining and mark-ups, as well as my ability to develop Engineering Drawings and Datasheets that accurately capture the technical requirements of a project. I have a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in these processes and can work effectively with cross-functional teams to ensure that all aspects of a project are thoroughly considered and accounted for.

            In addition to my technical expertise, I am skilled at facilitating touch-base meetings with Engineering, Operations, and Maintenance teams to discuss the status and progress of ongoing projects. These meetings are essential for keeping all stakeholders informed and engaged in the project, which is critical to ensuring successful project outcomes.

            As part of my work on MOC projects, I have also gained experience in facilitating Risk Assessments, participating in Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs). These activities are essential for identifying potential hazards and mitigating risks associated with MOC projects, and I am adept at guiding cross-functional teams through these processes to ensure that all risks are identified and addressed.

            Finally, I played a key role in helping to complete an audit of over 200 car seals, which was critical to ensuring that overpressure protection was maintained on site. This experience gave me valuable insights into the importance of attention to detail and the need to maintain high levels of safety and compliance in all aspects of plant operations.
