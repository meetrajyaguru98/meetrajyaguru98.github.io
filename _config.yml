  Hi, my name's Ankul and currently I'm a Financial Engineering Graduate student at Cornell University. I have worked for almost 2 years at J.P. Morgan as a part of Wholesale Credit Transformation team where we provided financial solutions and solved complex business problems using Machine Learning tools. I aim to learn and work more closely with securities, derivatives and equity indices.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Data Analytics</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>.
